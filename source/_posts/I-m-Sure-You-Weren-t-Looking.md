Hi there and welcome to my blog.  As the title suggests I am pretty sure you had no idea this blog or page even existed.  This is most likely due to the fact that I had not published anything until....just now.

Seriously though, thanks for taking a look and make sure to come back and check out my other posts as I muse on things ranging from mishaps while up on silks to technical discussions on distributed database clusters.

In my next post, I'm going to bring you through my experience setting up a Raspberry PI mixed-worlkload cluster using Cassandra.

See ya :)
